### **PackDraw "Click It" Loot Box Rating**

**Product Value:**

★★

Most items are low-value ($0.50 vouchers), making it difficult to recover the box's $12.68 cost. Mid-low value keyboards are common, but high-value items are nearly unattainable.

**Entertainment Value:**

★★★

The variety of keyboards and occasional mid-value items add some excitement, but the overwhelming probability of low-value vouchers diminishes the thrill.

**Randomness and Fairness:**

★★

High-value items have an extremely low total probability of 0.003%, and even mid-value items are under 1%, leaving most outcomes predictable and repetitive.

**Cost-Effectiveness:**

★★

With a return rate of **76.54%**, the box offers slightly better returns than some loot boxes, but the majority of players will still experience a loss.

**Overall Rating:**

★★

The "Click It" box is suitable for those seeking budget gaming keyboards but not for players hoping for high-value items or consistent returns.
