A growing TikTok trend featuring so-called “mystery boxes” is drawing criticism and concern from Australia Post, who warn the contents may pose serious privacy and security risks.

The trend, imported from the US and now booming among Australian content creators, involves purchasing and unboxing parcels that are reportedly “lost” or “unclaimed” mail. These sealed packages often still bear delivery labels — with names, addresses, and other personal information still visible.

While some vendors attempt to obscure this information, others merely slap on a sticker that can be easily peeled off, leaving personal details exposed. Items shown in the viral videos include:

- A charging dock addressed to Craig in Queensland

- Motorcycle parts for Mark in Tasmania

- A garden hose for Steven in South Australia

- A new pair of shoes intended for Belinda in Western Sydney

Sellers offer these bundles of mail at varying prices — from $50 for a small box of five parcels to $150 for larger mystery shipments.

Some packages even display official Australia Post markings, prompting the postal authority to issue a public warning.

> “Australia Post has significant concerns about the inclusion of addressed packaging within these boxes and confirms we have no connection or affiliation with the mystery box scheme,” a spokesperson told _Yahoo News_.
> 
> “We urge anyone who receives parcels or envelopes containing names and addresses to securely dispose of them.”
> 
> “Social media creators are encouraged to exercise caution and avoid revealing customer information when filming such content.”

**Returned Orders or Undeliverables?**

Experts believe that some of the packages being sold come from customers who changed their minds and returned items to retailers. These returned goods are sometimes sent to warehouses and resold instead of being discarded.

While that gives the products a second chance, it raises questions when original personal information hasn’t been fully removed.

**What Happens to Legitimately Unclaimed Mail?**

Each year, Australia Post handles more than 2.5 billion items. Occasionally, some mail can’t be delivered due to address issues or missing labels. These are redirected to Australia Post’s Mail Redistribution Centre, where they are opened and catalogued.

If no one files a lost item claim within two months, the items may be sold via official charity auctions. One such authorized auction house is **Theodore Bruce**, which has auctioned high-value items such as:

- Louis Vuitton handbags

- Smartphones, laptops, and tablets

- Premium sneakers (Nike, Yeezy)

- Kitchen devices including Thermomix

- Designer watches, sunglasses, and fashion pieces

**Key Differences from TikTok Boxes**

Unlike the viral mystery boxes, Australia Post only sells items after confirming no identifiable information remains. They also never sell sealed or randomly bundled parcels.

> “We never offer sealed packages or items with any visible recipient information. All sales follow a strict inspection process,” the spokesperson reiterated.

As interest in these “unclaimed parcel” videos grows, Australia Post calls on both consumers and content creators to prioritize privacy and safety — and think twice before turning someone’s lost package into social media entertainment.
